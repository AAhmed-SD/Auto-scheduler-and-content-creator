# AI Learning and Performance Tracking System

## Database Schema Overview

The system uses five main tables to track AI learning and performance:

1. **Content Performance Metrics**
   - Tracks engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, etc.)
   - Records time-based metrics
   - Stores audience demographics
   - Captures platform-specific metrics

2. **AI Learning Patterns**
   - Records successful content patterns
   - Tracks pattern success rates
   - Stores learning context
   - Monitors pattern evolution over time

3. **Content Style Analysis**
   - Analyzes visual, audio, and text styles
   - Correlates styles with engagement
   - Maintains style tags for categorization

4. **Trend Analysis**
   - Tracks platform-specific trends
   - Measures trend impact on engagement
   - Records trend lifecycles

5. **AI Improvement Tracking**
   - Monitors AI performance improvements
   - Compares before/after metrics
   - Tracks improvement context

## Safe Maintenance Operations

The system includes safe maintenance procedures:

1. **Archival Process**
   - Batched processing to prevent long transactions
   - Transaction management with error handling
   - Data preservation in archive tables
   - Configurable age thresholds

2. **System Maintenance**
   - Safe table analysis procedures
   - Monitoring and logging of operations
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling and reporting

## Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- User-specific data access policies
- Secure maintenance operations
- Audit logging of system changes

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Performance dashboards
- Style analysis views
- Trend impact analysis
- AI improvement tracking

## Best Practices
