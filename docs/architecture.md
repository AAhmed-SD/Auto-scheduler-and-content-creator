# Auto Scheduler & Content Creator Architecture

## System Overview

The Auto Scheduler & Content Creator platform is built with a microservices architecture, leveraging modern cloud infrastructure and managed services for reliability and scalability.

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

  - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  - Session management
  - Social login integration
- **JWT-based** authentication
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Row Level Security** (RLS) for data protection

### 2. Database & Storage
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** for primary data storage
  - Automatic backups
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Connection pooling
- **Redis** for caching and session storage
  - Distributed caching
  - Cache invalidation strategies
  - Cache warming for critical paths
  - Session management

### 3. Application Services
- **FastAPI** backend services
  - RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
  - WebSocket support
  - Async operations
  - Circuit breakers for external services
- **Celery** for background tasks
  - Task queues
  - Scheduled jobs
  - Retry mechanisms
- **Custom Email Service**
  - Transactional emails
  - Notifications
  - Templates

### 4. Infrastructure
- **AWS ECS** for container orchestration
  - Auto-scaling
  - Load balancing
  - Service discovery
- **AWS RDS** for managed PostgreSQL
  - Multi-AZ deployment
  - Automated backups
  - Performance monitoring
- **AWS ElastiCache** for Redis
  - Managed Redis instances
  - Automatic scaling
  - Backup and recovery
- **AWS WAF** for application protection
  - SQL injection protection
  - XSS protection
  - Rate limiting
  - Bot protection

### 5. Monitoring & Analytics
- **Custom Logging System**
  - Structured logging
  - Log aggregation
  - Error tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Response times
  - Resource utilization
  - Error rates
- **User Analytics**
  - Usage patterns
  - Feature adoption
  - Performance metrics
- **Real-time Dashboards**
  - System health
  - User activity
  - Performance metrics
  - Error tracking
