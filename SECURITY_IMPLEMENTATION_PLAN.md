## Security Features Implementation Details

### Frontend Security
```typescript
// Example of protected route implementation
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, roles }) => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  
  if (!roles.includes(user.role)) return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  
  return children;
};
```

### Backend Security
```python
# Example of FastAPI security middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def security_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Rate limiting
    if not await rate_limit(request):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=429, detail="Too many requests")
    
    # Security headers
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    
    return response
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Example of Row Level Security
CREATE POLICY content_access_policy ON content
    USING (owner_id = current_user_id())
    WITH CHECK (owner_id = current_user_id());
```

## Security Monitoring Setup

### Prometheus Configuration
```yaml
# Example of security metrics
security_metrics:
  - name: failed_login_attempts
    type: counter
    help: "Number of failed login attempts"
  - name: api_errors
    type: counter
    help: "Number of API errors"
  - name: security_events
    type: counter
    help: "Number of security events"
```

### Grafana Dashboard
```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "Security Metrics",
        "type": "graph",
        "datasource": "Prometheus",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(failed_login_attempts[5m])",
            "legendFormat": "Failed Logins"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
