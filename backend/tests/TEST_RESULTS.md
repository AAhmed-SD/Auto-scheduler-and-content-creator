## Conclusion

The application has a solid foundation with working core features, but significant functionality remains to be implemented and tested. The current test coverage is good for the implemented features, but we need to:

1. Complete implementation of remaining features
2. Add corresponding tests for new features
3. Expand test coverage for existing features
4. Implement more comprehensive security testing

This report will be updated as new features are implemented and tested.
